<h1>Swift Wall - Wallpaper Manager strings files</h1>

Welcome to the Swift Wall translation project!

A few important rules/things to keep in mind:

- If you don't understand something or don't exactly know how to translate it just move on to the next string.
- Always double check your translation for any typos.
- Don't just copy paste from Google Translate please, if you don't know something, move on.
- Some strings contain references to variables, for example like this: '%1$s' or similar. Do NOT translate these parts, you just have to place them in the right place in your translation.

Thanks a lot for respecting rules and helping me translate my app!
